# OBS Dynamic Overlay

This project is born from a desire to add dynamic overlays to OBS. This is done using an OBS Browser plugin and a .NET Core 3.0 app that can be run in a Docker container if wanted.

## OBS Browser plugins

There are two OBS Browser source plugins as far as I'm aware, these are:

 * [Browser Plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/browser-plugin.115/) for Windows
 * [Linux Browser](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/linux-browser.509/) for Linux

Both of these can be added as an extra source to your OBS scene and given the URL to this webapplication.
